# S3-Compatible API

The Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) does the same thing as the [Native API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-b2-native-api)—it allows you to interact with Backblaze B2—but it follows the S3 syntax. With the [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api), if your application is already written to use the S3 API, Backblaze B2 will just work, with minimal code changes on your end. The [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) provides developers with the following benefits:

- Performance will be just as good, and you'll get all the benefits of Backblaze B2.
- You can use your existing tools that are written to the S3 API.
- You do not have to learn a new API.

For all of the Backblaze API operations and their corresponding documentation, see [API Documentation](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs).

## Naming Restrictions

The [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) features slightly different restrictions on file and bucket names than the AWS S3 API. Refer to the [Buckets](https://www.backblaze.com/bb/docs/cloud-storage-buckets) and [Files](https://www.backblaze.com/bb/docs/cloud-storage-files) page for naming restrictions.

## Access Control Lists

The [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) features limited support for access control lists (ACLs). Get Object ACL and Get Bucket ACL calls will work as expected. However, object-level ACLs are not supported. For example, a Get Object ACL call returns the ACL for the bucket in which the object is contained.

If a bucket is private, the ACL that is returned for the bucket and any files within the bucket are "private." If a bucket is public, the ACL that is returned for the bucket and any files within the bucket are "public-read."

The [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) supports the Put Bucket ACL call to change between "private" and "public-read" only. Attempting to put a different value returns an error.

The call succeeds only when the specified ACL matches the ACL of the bucket.

## Pre-Signed URLs

The [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) supports pre-signed URLs for downloading and uploading. You can generate pre-signed URLs using the AWS CLI, AWS Tools for PowerShell, s3cmd, and AWS SDKs.

The following guides can help you configure these tools:

- [S3-Compatible SDKs](https://www.backblaze.com/bb/docs/cloud-storage-s3-compatible-sdks)
- [Native API SDKs](https://www.backblaze.com/bb/docs/cloud-storage-native-api-sdks)
- [s3cmd](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-use-s3cmd-with-backblaze-b2)
- [AWS Command-Line Interface](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-use-the-aws-cli-with-backblaze-b2)

## Server-Side Encryption

The [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) supports server-side encryption of data before storing using either Backblaze-managed keys (SSE-B2) or using customer-managed keys (SSE-C). For more information on supported SSE options, click [here](https://www.backblaze.com/bb/docs/cloud-storage-server-side-encryption).

## Get Object Tagging

The [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) does not fully support object tagging. Therefore, the implementation of `Get Object Tagging` returns a set of empty tags. This implementation is provided for compatibility with certain integrations.

## Copy Object and Tagging

The [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) does not fully support object tagging. The `x-amz-tagging-directive` header is allowed on the `Copy Object API`, but it will be ignored, no matter the value that you supply. Also, note that the `x-amz-tagging` header will be explicitly rejected if it is included on the `Copy Object` (or `Put Object`) API calls. This implementation is provided for compatibility with certain integrations.

## Unsupported Features

The [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) does not currently support the following features:

- Browser-based uploads to pre-signed URLs using `POST`
- Website Configuration
- Object Tagging
- IAM Roles
- ACLs

## IPv6 Support

The [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) now supports IPv6. No changes to your code should be required to use IPv6 addresses with Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage and the [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api).

### What is IPv6?

IPv6 is a version of the Internet Protocol that uses a larger address space than IPv4, its predecessor and currently the most common format for IP addresses. IPv6 addresses consist of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits with each group separated by a colon. For example: `2001:db8:1f70:999:de8:7648:3a49:6e8`. In comparison, IPv4 notation consists of four groups of decimal digits with the groups separated by dots. For example: `198.51.100.1`.

### Can I still use IPv4 addresses?

Yes. The [S3-Compatible API](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api) will continue to support IPv4 addresses for the foreseeable future.

### Will using IPv6 incur additional costs?

No.

### Is IPv6 more secure than IPv4?

Requests to our APIs using IPv4 or IPv6 have equally secure connections and use the same strong TLS encryption. However, some customers may see a performance improvement if IPv6 allows them to avoid NAT.
