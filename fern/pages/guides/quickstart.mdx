---

Use this guide to build applications that use Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage in thirty minutes or less using the S3-Compatible API or the B2 Native API.

## Overview

Backblaze B2 is public cloud object storage with an S3-Compatible API, so you can configure almost any application, tool, or SDK designed for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

As well as its S3-Compatible API, Backblaze B2 provides its own Native API. Most of the native API operations are equivalent to Amazon S3 actions. There are a few native API calls for Backblaze B2-specific functionality, but the S3-Compatible API has everything that most applications need.

## Enable B2 Cloud Storage

Before you begin, you must have a [Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage account](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/sign-up.html).

1. [Sign in](https://secure.backblaze.com/user_signin.htm) to the Backblaze web console.
2. In the user menu in the upper-right corner of the page, select **My Settings**.
3. Under **Enabled Products**, select the checkbox to enable B2 Cloud Storage.
4. Review the Terms and Conditions, and click **OK** to accept them.

## Create a Bucket

1. [Sign in](https://secure.backblaze.com/user_signin.htm) to the Backblaze web console.
2. In the left navigation menu under **B2 Cloud Storage**, click **Buckets**.
3. Click **Create a Bucket**.
4. Enter a name for your bucket. Bucket names must be at least six characters and globally unique.
5. Select a privacy setting: **Private** or **Public**.
6. If applicable, enable [server-side encryption](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-server-side-encryption).
7. Enable [Object Lock](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-object-lock) to restrict a file from being modified or deleted for a specified period of time.
8. Click **Lifecycle Settings** to control how long to keep the files in your new bucket.
9. Click **Create a Bucket**, and copy the value that is in the **Endpoint** field.

<Note>
You can change a bucket's privacy settings at any time. Files that are in a private bucket require authentication to perform an action, for example, downloading. Public buckets do not require authentication so you can easily access files.
</Note>

## Upload a File

You can upload files to a Backblaze B2 bucket from your local drive. The maximum single file size that you can upload through the Backblaze web console is 500 MB.

1. [Sign in](https://secure.backblaze.com/user_signin.htm) to the Backblaze web console.
2. In the left navigation menu under **B2 Cloud Storage**, click **Buckets**.
3. In your bucket details, click **Upload/Download** and click **Upload**.
4. Drop your files from your local drive into the dialog box, or manually select your files.
5. In the left navigation menu, click **Browse Files** to see your uploaded file.

## Create an Application Key

1. [Sign in](https://secure.backblaze.com/user_signin.htm) to the Backblaze web console.
2. In the left navigation menu under **B2 Cloud Storage**, click **Application Keys**.
3. Click **Add a New Application Key**, and enter an app key name.
4. Select **All** or select a specific bucket in the **Allow Access to Bucket(s)** menu.
5. Optionally, select your access type (Read and Write, Read Only, or Write Only).
6. Optionally, select **Allow List All Bucket Names** (required for `b2_list_buckets` and S3 List Buckets operations).
7. Optionally, enter a file name prefix to restrict application key access.
8. Optionally, enter a positive integer to limit the time, in seconds, before the application key expires.
9. Click **Create New Key**, and note the resulting `keyID` and `applicationKey` values.

<Warning>
When you create a new app key, the `applicationKey` appears only once. Make sure you copy and securely save this value.
</Warning>

## Create Applications

You can use AWS developer tools to access Backblaze B2 programmatically:

- **CLI** — Use the AWS Command-Line Interface to interact with Backblaze B2.
- **Python** — Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to build applications.
- **Java** — Use the AWS SDK for Java to build applications.
