description: Overview of the Backblaze B2 Native API for interacting with B2 Cloud Storage.
---

The Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage Native API is Backblaze's custom API that enables you to interact with Backblaze B2. It provides full functionality for file upload/download, bucket management, application key management, and more.

## Getting Started

1. Create a [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) account and [enable Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-enable-backblaze-b2).
2. Create an [application key](/guides/getting-started/authentication) to authenticate your API requests.
3. Call `b2_authorize_account` to obtain an authorization token and base URLs.
4. Use the authorization token for subsequent API calls.

## API Base URL

The base URL for most B2 Native API operations is returned by the `b2_authorize_account` call. It looks similar to `https://apiNNN.backblazeb2.com`, where `NNN` is the cluster number.

## Key Management

Key management is unique to the Native API (the S3-Compatible API does not support it). You can:

- **Create keys** with `b2_create_key` — Restrict by bucket, file prefix, capabilities, and expiration.
- **List keys** with `b2_list_keys` — View all application keys associated with your account.
- **Delete keys** with `b2_delete_key` — Revoke access by deleting a key.

## Pre-Signed URLs

Instead of pre-signed URLs, the Native API uses authorization tokens. The `b2_authorize_account` request provides a token for all account-level operations. For download-only access, use `b2_get_download_authorization` to generate a scoped token.

## Large File Uploads

Files larger than the recommended part size (typically 100 MB) should be uploaded in parts:

1. **Start** — Call `b2_start_large_file` to get a file ID.
2. **Get Upload URL** — Call `b2_get_upload_part_url` to get a URL and token for uploading parts.
3. **Upload Parts** — Call `b2_upload_part` for each part (1 to 10,000 parts).
4. **Finish** — Call `b2_finish_large_file` with the SHA1 checksums of all parts.

If you need to cancel, call `b2_cancel_large_file` to clean up.

## Supported Connection Protocols

Only HTTPS requests are supported. FTP and SSH are not officially supported.

## API Versions

The current B2 Native API version is **v4**. Key changes in v4 include support for Multi-Bucket Application Keys. See the [API Versions](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-native-api-versions) page for detailed version history.
