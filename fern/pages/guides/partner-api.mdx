The Backblaze Partner API empowers you to programmatically create and manage a large number of Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage accounts and groups within your applications.

## Overview

The Partner API enables you to automate the following:

- **Account creation** — Add new Group members by creating Backblaze accounts.
- **Organize accounts** — Group accounts together for management.
- **List Groups** — View all active Groups you administer.
- **List Group members** — View members within a specific Group.
- **Eject members** — Remove a member from a Group.

## Prerequisites

1. [Create a Backblaze account](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/sign-up.html).
2. [Enable Business Groups and B2 Cloud Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-create-a-partner-account).
3. [Create a Group](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-create-a-group-for-the-partner-api) for organizing member accounts.
4. [Create a Master Application Key](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-create-a-master-app-key-for-the-partner-api).
